 * Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.
 * You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

 * Example 1:
 * Input: [3,2,3]
 * Output: 3

 * Example 2:
 * Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
 * Output: 2

         * element in that suffix. To do this, we maintain a count, which is incremented whenever we see an instance of
         * our current candidate for majority element and decremented whenever we see anything else. Whenever count
         * equals 0, we effectively forget about everything in nums up to the current index and consider the current
         * number as the candidate for majority element. It is not immediately obvious why we can get away with forgetting
         * prefixes of nums - consider the following examples (pipes are inserted to separate runs of nonzero count).
